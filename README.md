Shell-Scripts
=============

Scripts I wrote to make my life easier.  They are easy to rename, so if you want to use them you may rename them to what ever you feel like.

	TODO:
		Comment all current 4 scripts to make them human readable
		Create Table of contents

	Script Ideas:
	Server Backup Script - General server recursive folder backup to a single repository
	Wrapper to enable a 1 command backup of my entire server.  Possible to set on a cron job
